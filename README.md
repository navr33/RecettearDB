# RecettearDB

Example of an SQLite database connected to a frontend through SQLAlchemy and FastAPI.

It uses the item properties from the game Recettear as reference, but it's not actually meant as a full database for it.

After installing the requirements simply run the following code in this projects base folder:

```
fastapi run main.py
```

Then open the html in the web folder and try it out.
